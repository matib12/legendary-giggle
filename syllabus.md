# Advanced Programming for Scientists — Syllabus

## Course Description

This course introduces advanced programming concepts and tools commonly used in modern scientific research and computational environments. The focus is on **practical, real-world workflows**, collaborative development, and performance-aware computing, with examples drawn from current student projects and scientific use cases.

Students will actively contribute to the course material using **GitHub issues and pull requests**, simulating real open-source and research software development practices.
