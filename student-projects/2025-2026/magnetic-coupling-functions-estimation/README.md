# Magnetic Coupling Functions Estimation
*Author*: Lunghini Lorenzo


This projects amis to estimate the magnetic coupling funcions of the Virgo North End Building (NEB) and Central Building (CEB).

We want to measure the coupling of the detector with magnetic field, the procedure is inject magnetic field noise using a large coil ~4m x 4m for CEB and ~3m x 3m for NEB all with 111 loops each, the current that flows into the coils is 7 A max and 70 V max. 

We first inject the noise with the interferometer put in its working point for scientific data taking, and then we analyse the response in the sensitivity correlated to the injected magnetic field seen by the magnetometers.

It will not be possible to share data due to Collaboration policy.
