# Project name

   Database for Probe Station Measurements

# Problem description

   Each measurement is currently a separate .txt file, with a specific structure depending on the measurement type (I–V, C–V, van der Pauw, etc.). Consequently, plotting and data analysis require loading and parsing all relevant files each time.

The goal is to identify a more efficient data storage strategy that enables faster retrieval for visualization and analysis.
